### libwuff

This is a WAVE audio file reading library. It was originally created [for the LÖVE framework](https://love2d.org). The only available source is currently in the GitHub repo for said framework, as the BitBucket repo has since been deleted when they removed mercurial repositories. This repository is intended for preservation purposes. Although it can be used quite reliably in projects, there are more modern solutions, such as [dr_wav](https://github.com/mackron/dr_libs/blob/master/dr_wav.h) that may suit needs better.

Pull requests that fix things they are welcome, as are issues. However, I cannot guaruntee that issues will be resolved either in a timely manner nor at all.
